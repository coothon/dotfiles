# AwesomeWM

A custom config that is a heavily modified version of someone else's config (I can't remember whom). Includes a random wallpaper selection feature (the code is at the bottom of [the rc.lua](/.config/awesome/rc.lua)) that chooses a random image from ./random\_wallpapers/ to set as the background.
